# Italy Transplant Atlas – Data Pipeline Project

This project builds a unified dataset on **Solid Organ Transplants (SOTs)** in Italy from **2010 to 2024** and **Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplants (Allo-HCTs)** in Italy in 2023 only . The aim is to support transparent, reproducible, and accessible **data visualization** for public insight, policy discussions, and academic research.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The project follows a full data pipeline, from raw data scraping to visualization-ready output.

---

### 1. 🔍 Data Collection (Scraping)

- **HCT data** was extracted from 2023 annual [**PDF report**](https://www.trapianti.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_cntPubblicazioni_636_allegato.pdf) published by the *Centro Nazionale Trapianti (CNT)*.
- **SOT data** was scraped from the [**Sistema Informativo Trapianti (SIT)**](https://trapianti.sanita.it/statistiche/trapianti_per_anno.aspx) dynamic web portal using automated scripts.

**Jupyter notebooks:**
- 🧾 **2 notebooks** for HCT scraping:
  - Parsing and structuring semi-structured PDF tables.

- 🌐 **5 notebooks** for SOT scraping:
  - HTML structure inspection.
  - Scraping strategy and reusable tools (`utils.py`).
  - Iterative data extraction for all organs and centers, 2010–2024.

---

### 2. 🧼 Data Cleaning & Normalization

- Standardization of center names across datasets.
- Deduplication and harmonization of naming variants (e.g., removing suffixes, resolving aliases).
- Introduction of a `Type` field:
  - `"SOT only"` – center performs only organ transplants.
  - `"HCT only"` – center performs only allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplants.
  - `"SOT+HCT"` – center performs both.

---

### 3. 🔄 Data Integration

The cleaned datasets were transformed into a common structure:

```text
region | city | center_name | center_type | patient | organ | subtype | number | year
```
Both datasets were merged into a **single file** for downstream visualization and analysis.

---

### 4. 💾 Output for Visualization
The unified dataset was exported in multiple formats:

- `transplants_italy_clean.csv` – for integration with BI tools.

- `transplants_italy_clean.xlsx` – for inspection and manual analysis.

Compatible with:

📊 Tableau Public

📈 Power BI

### 🚀 Data Visualization

Use this dataset to build interactive dashboards, conduct regional analyses, and explore trends over time across transplant types and centers.
